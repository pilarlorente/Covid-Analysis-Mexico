# Analysis and prediction models of the Covid-19 situation in Mexico
Mexico, as the rest of the world, has been strongly affected by Coronavirus pandemic. This project analyzes the situation on the 2020, 14th November, taking the data provided by the mexican goverment (you can download more data on [Government of Mexico](https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/informacion-referente-a-casos-covid-19-en-mexico))

Through an exploratory analysis of the data, this work shows the most affected states, the relation between other diseases and get positive or die, among other aspects. After that, I propose two classification algorithms to predict the probability of death if you are diagnosed covid-19 positive.
